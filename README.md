# Stock Trend Prediction using LSTM

## Overview
This project implements a stock trend prediction model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. It provides real-time stock data visualization and price predictions through a Streamlit web application.

## Features
- Real-time stock data retrieval using Yahoo Finance API
- Interactive stock selection through user input
- Data visualization of closing prices and moving averages
- LSTM-based price prediction model
- Comparative visualization of predicted vs. actual stock prices

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow/Keras for LSTM model
- Streamlit for web application
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Matplotlib for data visualization
- yfinance for stock data retrieval
- scikit-learn for data preprocessing

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stock-trend-prediction.git
   cd stock-trend-prediction
   ```
2. Install required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Run the Streamlit app:
   ```
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
2. Enter a stock ticker symbol (default is '^NSEI' for NIFTY 50)
3. Explore the visualizations and predictions

## Model Details
- The LSTM model is pre-trained on historical stock data
- The model uses 100 days of historical data to predict the next day's closing price
- Data is normalized using MinMaxScaler before feeding into the model

## File Structure
- `app.py`: Main Streamlit application
- `keras_model.keras`: Pre-trained LSTM model
- `StockAnalysis.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing model development and analysis

## Data Visualization
The app provides three main visualizations:
1. Closing price vs. Time
2. 20-day Moving Average
3. 20-day and 50-day Moving Averages

## Prediction
The app shows a comparison between predicted stock prices and actual prices for the test period.

## Limitations
- The model's accuracy is subject to market volatility and unforeseen events
- Predictions should not be used as the sole basis for investment decisions

## Future Improvements
- Incorporate sentiment analysis from news and social media
- Implement multi-variate analysis including volume and other technical indicators
- Develop an ensemble model combining LSTM with other machine learning algorithms
